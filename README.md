## Repository Organisation

Please see below for a quick roadmap of the subfolders into which this repository has been organised.

### data

Raw data files are stored in this folder. I also explain the process of choosing the data, and cleaning it for use in the project.

### design

Stored in this folder are documents pertaining to data presentation, including colour schemes, choice of graphs, and any accompanying illustrations. I explain why I made the design choices I did and how it contributes to the overall meaning of the project. 

### theory

Information pertaining to hypothesis and methodology are stored here. I explain what I wanted to show and how I went about the project.

Stored in this folder is the code used to generate the elements of this visualisation. For this project, I use D3.js, a popular Javascript library for data visualisation.
