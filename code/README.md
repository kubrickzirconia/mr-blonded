### data

The [frankocean tumblr archive][2] details each post Frank made from his tumblr account, which covers a period from 2010 to 2019. You can filter by month/year to clearly see how many posts were made in a given month. This is the basis for this bar chart, where each bar represents a month of tumblr activity. 

For each datapoint, the following information is provided:

* date: month and year are provided - these will form the X axis 
* value: the number of tumblr posts in that month - determines the height of the bar, measured against the Y axis
* colour: colour code for the bar - standard is black, then coloured for each month with an album release
* httpLink: hyperlink to the particular month in the archive

### presentation

When a bar is hovered over, the colour changes to a pale grey and the user is able to click on a given bar to be directed to that month in Frank's archive.
