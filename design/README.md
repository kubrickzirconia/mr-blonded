## colour

Frank Ocean is acutely atune to the symbolism of colour and the personal meaning colours can hold for the individual. Thus, the decisions surrounding the colour palette need to be taken seriously.

* Nostalgia Ultra: Forest Green
* Channel Orange: Orange
* Endless: Silver
* Blonde: Yellow

Asides from these accents, I've chosen to stick to a black and white theme, as a reflection of Frank's minimalism.
