# theory

The purpose of this project is not to answer a particular question, to prove a hypothesis, or to make an argument. The primary purpose is to explore Frank Ocean's musical output. Each component of this visualisation has been designed to shed some light on Frank's creative output and his reluctant celebrity status.

## frank's tumblr

Although infamously aloof, Frank Ocean has, since 2010, been relatively active on tumblr, using it as a space for him to communicate with his fans and share ideas. I thought it would be potentially interesting to look at how his relationship with tumblr has changed over time, with the aim of addressing the following questions:

1. How has his usage of tumblr fluctuated over time?
2. How does his usage of tumblr change when he is releasing a new album?

I have chosen a simple bar chart to visualise Frank's tumblr. The X axis is chronological, divided into months. The Y axis measures the number of posts Frank made. Months where Frank released an album are highlighted in a different colour, making any trends obvious to spot. 

Each bar is hyperlinked, so the user can click on it to be directed to that month in Frank's tumblr archive.
