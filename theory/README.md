# theory

The purpose of this project is not to answer a particular question, to prove a hypothesis, or to make an argument. The primary purpose is to explore Frank Ocean's musical output. 

## runtime comparison

comparing his major solo works over the course of their runtime. 

## frank's tumblr

Although infamously aloof, Frank Ocean has, since 2010, been relatively active on tumblr, using it as the main space for him to communicate with his fans and share ideas. I thought it would be potentially interesting to look at how his relationship with tumblr has changed over time, with the aim of addressing the following questions:

1. How has his usage of tumblr fluctuated over time?
2. How does his usage of tumblr change when he is releasing a new album?

I have chosen a simple bar chart to visualise Frank's tumblr. The X axis is chronological, divided into months. The Y axis measures the number of posts Frank made. Months where Frank released an album are highlighted in a different colour, making any trends obvious to spot. 

Each bar is hyperlinked, so the user can click on it to be directed to that month in Frank's tumblr archive.
